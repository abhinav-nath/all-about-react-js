# Create a new React App

```shell
npx create-react-app my-app

cd my-app

npm start
```

`npm install` downloads all the dependencies into the `node_modules` folder

`index.js` is the first code file that is executed whenever we launch the web app.

`package.json` is like `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`
